**Heads up!** Writing this lib wasnâ€™t necessary after all. [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) is what I went for after all. Here are a couple of further alternatives:

* [elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
* [stereo](https://github.com/tomekwi/stereo)

This is soon to become a minimal library for managing dataflow processes. Code-over-configuration and callbacks everywhere. For browsers as well as node.



Isn't that squatting, matey?
----------------------------

Yup, there's no excuse. What's ready at the moment is the idea, the name and some branding. No later than March 2015 will I put code where my mouth is.

If you really, really need this name, feel free to contact me at t.wiszniewski@gmail.com

**Update:** I set the name free long ago, by the way. Feel free to use the name and the logo, if you want.
